# Forecasting tool for hospital demand during heat periods

This tool has been developed by researchers at ISPM, University of Bern, in the context of the NCCS project about impacts of climate change on health in Switzerland.

This forecasting tool allows to:
(i) quantify the association between visits to emergency department and daily temperature, based on historical data provided;
(ii) generate short-term forecasts of the expected number of patient visits on new data, given temperature and number of visits observed in the past week and temperature forecasts for the next days.

We showcase an application of the tool to data from the emergency department at Bern University Hospital, and mean temperature data for the city of Bern.
You can upload your own data to test the tool for your case study. Check this [user guide](https://hospital-forecasting-tool.ispm.unibe.ch/USER-GUIDE.html) for detailed instructions on how to use this tool.

If you use this tool, please refer to the following manuscript:
